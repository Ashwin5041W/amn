    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h4>
        You might have heard that wool and silk fibres are obtained from animals. Wool is obtained from the fleece (hair) of sheep or yak. Silk fibres come from cocoons of the silk moth. Do you know which part of the sheep's body yields fibres? Are you aware how these fibres are converted into the woollen yarn that we buy from the market to knit swearters? <br> Do you have any idea how silk fibres are made into silk, which is woven into sarees? In this article we shall try to find answers to these questions. 
    </h4>
    <h3>Animal fibres - Wool and Silk</h3>
    <h4>
        Wool comes from sheep, goat, yak and some other animals. These wool-yielding animals bear hair on their body. Do toy know why these animals have a thick coat of hair? Hair trap a lot of air. Air is a poor conductor of heat, as you would learn in this article. So, hair keeps these animals warm. Wool is derived from these hairy fibres.
    </h4>
    <h3>Animals that yield wool</h3>
    <h4>
        Several breeds of sheep are found in different parts of our country. However, the fleece of sheep is not the only source of wool, though wool commonly available in the market is sheep wool. Yak wool is common in Tibet and Ladakh. Angora wool is obtained from hilly regions such as Jammy and Kashmir. <br> Wool is also obtained from goat hair. The under fur of Kashmiri goat is soft. It is woven into fine shawls called Pashmina shawls. The fur (hair) on the body of camels is also used as wool. Llama and Alpaca, found in South America, also yield wool.

    <h3>From fibres to wool</h3>
    <h4>
        For obtaining wool. Sheep are reared. Their hair is cut and processed into wool. Let us learn about this process.
        <strong><em>Rearing and breeding of sheep:</em></strong> If you travel to the hills in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Arunanchal Pradesh and Sikkim, or the plains of Haryana, Punjab, Rajastan, and Gujurat, you can see shepherds taking their herds of sheep for grazing sheep, reares also feed them on a mixture of pulses, corn, jowar, oil cakes (material left after taking out oil from seeds) and minerals. In winter, sheep are kept indoors and fed on leaves, grain, and dry fodder. <br> Sheep are reared in many parts of our country for wool. below are some sheep types which give different type of wool.

        Processing fibres into wool
    </h3>
    <h4>
        The wool which is used for knitting sweaters or for weaving shawls is the finished product of a long process which involves the following steps:-
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <strong><em>STEP 1:-</em></strong> The fleece of the sheep along with thin layer of skin is removed from it's body. This process is called <strong>shearing</strong>. Machines similar to those used by barbers are used to shave off hair. Usually hair are removed during the hot weather. This enables sheep to survive without their protective coat of hair. The hair provide woollen yarn. Shearing does not hurt the sheep just as it does not hurt when you get a hait cut or your father shaves his beard. Do you know why? The uppermost layer of the skin is dead. Also, the hair of sheep grow again just as your hair does.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <strong><em>STEP 2:-</em> The sheared skin with hair is thorughly washed in tanks to remove grease, dust and dirt. This is called scouring. Now a days scouring is done by machines.</strong>   
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <strong><em>STEP 3:-</em> After scouring, sorting is done. The hairy skin is sent to a factory where hair of different textures are separated or sorted.</strong>
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <strong>
            <em>
                STEP 4:-
            </em>
        </strong>
        The small fluffy fibres, called burrs, are the same burrs which sometimes appear on your sweaters. The fibres are scoured again and dried. This is the wool ready to be drawn into fibres.     
    </h4>
    <h4>
        <strong>
            <em>
                STEP 4:-
            </em>
        </strong>
        The fibres are straigtened, combed and rolled into yarn. The longer fibres are made into wool for sweaters and the shorter are spun and woven into woollen cloth.

            SILK
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Silk fibres are also animal fibres. Silkworms spin the 'silk fibres'. The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture. 
        </h4>
        <h2>
            Life history of silk moth
        </h2>
        <h4>
            The female silk moth lays eggs, from which hatch larva are called caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in size and when the caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of it's life history called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold itself. Then it swings it's head from side to side. During these movements of the head, the caterpillar secretes fibre made of protien which hardens on exposure to air and becomes silk fibres. Soon the caterpillar completely covers itself by silk fibres and turns into pupa.
            This covering is known as cocoon. The further development of the pupa into moth continues inside the cocoon. Silk fibres are used for weaving silk cloth. Can you imagine that the soft silk yarn is as strong as a comparable thread of steel! 
        </h4>
        <h4>
            The silk yarn is obtained from the cocoon of the silk moth. There is a variety of silk moths which look very different from one another and the silk yarn they yield is different in texture. 
        </h4>

    Did you know?
</h2>
        <h4>
            The most common silk moth is the mullberry silk moth. The silk fibre from the cocoon of this moth is soft, lustrous and elastic and can be dyed in beautiful colors. <br> Sericulture or culture of silkworms is a very old occupation in India. India produces plenty of silk on a commercial scale.

            Discovery of Silk
        </h2>
        <h4>
            The exact time of discovery of silk is perhaps unknown. According to an old Chinese legend, the empress Si-lung-Chi was asked by the emperor Huang-ti to find the cause of the damaged leaves of mullberry trees growing in their garden. The empress found white worms eating up mullberry leaves. She also noticed that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them. Accidently a cocoon dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads seperated from the cocoon. Silk industry began in China  and was kept a closely guarded secret for hundreds of years. Later on, traders and travellers introduced silk to other countries. The route they travelled is still called the 'silk route'.
